# Spreadsheet

Your task is to create a representation of a spreadsheet:
- a spreadsheet should have a fixed number of columns (specified as string-
names at creation)
- a spreadsheet should have infinitely many rows (numbered, starting at 0)
- each cell contains a number, defaulting to 0

## You should be able to:
- set the value of a cell
- get the value of a cell
- print out the first N rows of the spreadsheet (don’t worry too much about making
this pretty)
